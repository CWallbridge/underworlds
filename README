Underworlds: Geometric & Temporal Representation for Robots
-----------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Underworlds is a distributed and lightweight framework that aims at sharing
between clients parallel models of the physical world surrounding a robot.

The clients can be geometric reasoners (that compute topological relations
between objects), motion planner, event monitors, viewers... any software that
need to access a geometric (based on 3D meshes of objects) and/or temporal
(based on events) of the world.

One of the main specific feature of Underworlds is the ability to store many
parallel worlds: past models of the environment, future models, models with
some objects filtered out, models that are physically consistent, etc.

This package provides the library, and a small set of core clients that are
useful for inspection and debugging.

Installation
============

> python setup.py install

Testing Underworlds
===================

1- Start the `underworlds` daemon:

> underworlded start

2- Load some model:

 > uwds-load testing/res/monkey_mat.dae test

This loads 3 monkey heads in the 'test' world.

3- Get a 3D view of this world:

> uwds-view test

Open an OpenGL windows that display the content of the 'test' world. You can
click on meshes to move them with the keyboard.
